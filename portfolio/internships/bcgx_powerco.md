Part of the **[BCG Data Science](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/cognizant/artificial-intelligence-rtbq)** Internship program 

In this project, we work with another client who is a major **gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises**

- The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are **more options than ever for customers to choose from**
- They are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers
- We investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning
- Conduct feature engineering that is used to test hypotheses related to customer churn
- And finally we utilise predictive modelling so that it can be used to highlight customers at risk of churn
